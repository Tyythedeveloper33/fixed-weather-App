## Description
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly. This Weather Dashboard allows you to search for a city and view current and future weather conditions, including the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It also provides a 5-day forecast for the selected city.
